# Calculator-React-Redux

This is a calculator built by react with Redux.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Check you got proper version Node.js and npm already. 

```
node --version
npm --version
```

### Installing

Install node_modules all the project needs.

```
npm install
```

Wait a little time for installing and finally project is done.

## Running the npm scripts

Here are some npm scripts about webpack that I had set for project.

### Using Watching Mode

"watch" all files. If one of these files is updated, the code will be recompiled so you don't have to run the full build manually.

```
npm run watch
```

### Using webpack-dev-server

The webpack-dev-server module provides you with a simple web server and the ability to use live reloading.

```
npm run dev
```

### Basic build

This will clean and then create directory /dist and compiled modules according to settings of webpack.config.js.

```
npm run build
```

### Using http-server

http-server module is a simple http server and it is easy to start up.

```
npm start
```
